        <p class="lndMission">Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 70% of Americans are now working at
          home according to data from Pew Research Center. Consequently, the lack of exercise performed by both children
          and adults is nowhere near enough for optimal health. This lack of exercise leaves billions susceptible to
          harmful health issues, some of which include obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Postrainer is heavily
          concerned with these statistics and lack of self-care physically. Thus, we as a team aim to solve this problem
          by encouraging and simplifying the process of exercising in an effective and efficient manner through our
          AI-poweredderewopapp.</p>
