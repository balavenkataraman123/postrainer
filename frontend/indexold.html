      <br><br><p>Out of a study using data from 358 surveys across 168 countries and 1.9 million people, 27.5%,<br>or nearly 1.4 billion adults as the study estimates, don’t get enough exercise on a week-to-week<br>basis - World Helath Organization Survey (WHO)</p>
      <p> About 80% of U.S. adults and children aren’t getting enough exercise for optimal health - Cleveland<br>Clinic</p>
      <p>"Good posture allows for proper alignment of the body, which promotes optimal functioning for our<br>muscle, ligaments, and joints." - Austin Martinez, a certified trainer and director of education for<br>StretchLab.</p>
      <p>"When your posture is out of alignment, this may not allow muscles to function properly and/or<br>require other muscles to take on an additional load." - Dr. Sharif Tabbah, a physical therapist and<br>co-founder of Athletix Rehab in Miami.</p>
      <p>“Doing an exercise wrong is not only dangerous, but can cause muscle imbalances in your physique<br>and limit your muscle's movement. If one muscle is overworked because it takes over the movement,<br>you'll neglect the other muscles and won't see the results that you're looking for.” - Fred from Men's Fitness.</p>
      <p>New survey reveals 39.4% of Americans "never" exercise with massive regional discrepancies</p>
